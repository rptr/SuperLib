2017-04-01 - Version 40

Fix:
- RoadPathFinder::FindPath and ::GetFindPathError was not responding as
documented
- RoadBuilder timeout was not working
- Road::GrowStation was connecting added stop in a suboptimal way
- A few debug messages printed using AILog was fixed to use the Log system 

Thanks to yorg for debugging and posting patches that contributed towards
solving the timeout problem.

2015-06-16 - Version 39

Fix:
- Station.CostToDemolishStation was wrongly referencing a method in PAXLink
  which was not yet ported to SuperLib.

Feature:
- New method Tile::CostToClearTiles that return the cost to demolish all
  tiles in the provided list.

2014-03-23 - Version 38

Fix:
- Some internal code relied on some sub libraries being imported.

2014-03-09 - Version 37

Fix:
- Crash if Direction::GetDirString was supplied with an invalid direction

Feature:
- New method Direction::GetDirectionToTileApprox which gets the direction from
  tile1 to tile 2, and always returns a direction even if not exactly on one
  of the 8 DIR_* directions.
- New method Helper::Trim(string): removes leading/trailing spaces of string
- New methods to get/print SuperLib version

2013-07-20 - Version 36

Fix:
- Money.Inflate was discarding amounts below 100 money units.

Feature:
- Method to check if OpenTTD is affected by FS#5561 (DoCommands returning 
id 0 for all objects created in world gen)

2013-07-19 - Version 35

Change:
- Require minimum r25621 to consider StoryBook existing. r25620 and r25621
fixes two important bugs of the StoryBook. Before that it is better to fall
back to GSGoal.Question than annoying users with these known bugs.

2013-07-19 - Version 34

Fix:
- Reduce risk of overflow in money.nut

Feature:
- Allow clearing all signs except one tile

2013-07-19 - Version 33

Fix:
- The NoBuild custom RPF had usage of GS API (roadpathfinder.nut)
- Fix: Station.IsCargoSupplied used GS API calls (station.nut)

2013-07-15 - Version 32

Fix:
- AI version of SuperLib 30 and 31 was not working because OpenTTD 
interpreted GSGoal in story.nut too early (and killed the AI because of that)

2013-07-15 - Version 31

Fix:
- Detection of if StoryBook API exist gave false positives on 1.3.x RCs
released later in time than the introduction of StoryBook. Now look for
cargodist as a sign that StoryBook also exist. (a check for the revision
when StoryBook and CargoDist was introduced in trunk filters out old patch 
CargoDist builds)

2013-07-15 - Version 30

Feature:
- Story.NewStoryPage2 - returns an array with both page id and page elements

Fix:
- Airport::GetNumAircraftInAirportQueue didn't support heliports.
- Use improved Money::BurnMoney by Kogut
- Document return value of BuildNextToRoad

2013-06-09 - Version 29

Feature:
- New helper methods to work with the GSStoryBook api (not available for AIs)

2013-05-19 - Version 28

Feature:
- Two methods mainly intended for GSes who set cargo goals for checking if a
  town is a desert or snow town which uses [AI|GS]Tile.GetTerrainType if it
  is available and transparently fall back to a heuristic when OpenTTD 1.3.0
  or older is used.
	- Town.IsDesertTown
	- Town.IsSnowTown
- Helper.GetOpenTTDVersion - a direct copy of GetVersion in AiLibCommon
  However, in general it is better to check for the availability of APIs
  directly rather than using this method. (solution proposed by krinn) 
  For example: 
    if ("GetTerrainType" in AITile) { /* do something */ }


2012-11-17 - Version 27

Fixes:
- The value set via RoadBuilder::SetEstimateMultiplier was not used passed
  along to the pathfinder. (thanks to 11Runner for reporting this bug)
- The Airport sub library wrongly assumed that the log class have been
  imported as "Log".

Other:
- Replaced the tar building script with a newer one which automatically
  include the version number in the tar files.
- Include changelog.txt in version control.


2012-09-29 - Version 26

Features:
- Add: BuildAirportForIndustry - a function that builds an airport for an 
  industry
- Feature: Road.FixRoadStopFront - a function that tries to adjust the road 
  infront of a road stop so a depot can be added without blocking the ability to connect it to the world
- Add: Road.RemoveRoadInfrontOfRemovedRoadStopOrDepot that makes use of 
  RemoveRoadFull unless it may damage used road in which case it falls back 
  to RemoveRoad

Fixes:
- Fix: remove debug signs that the library spawned under some conditions even
  without the debug sign setting being active.
- Fix: Tile.IsBuildOnSlope_Flat returned true on steep slopes
- Fix: When removing road stations, road bits could be left behind on sloped 
  terrain


2012-08-19 - Version 25

Feature: Road, RoadBuilder and RoadPathFinder sub libraries are now available
  in the nogo edition of SuperLib

Other news: new methods in Station and Helper sub libraries
