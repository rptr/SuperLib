/* Q: How to use the sub libraries without the SuperLib prefix?
 *
 * A: Import the library under a name, eg SuperLib and then make global 
 *    pointers to those sub-libraries that you want to use:
 *
 *      Import("util.superlib", "SuperLib", 1);
 *
 *      Helper <- SuperLib.Helper;
 *      Direction <- SuperLib.Direction;
 *      Tile <- SuperLib.Tile;
 *
 *    Then you can call eg. Helper.SetSign(some_tile, "sign text");

/* Info: SuperLib contains a Log system which you either can use in your own
 *    AI or just live with the fact that SuperLib internally uses it.
 * 
 *    More info about the log system can be found in log.nut including
 *    help for using it in your AI and how to change the amount of information
 *    that is printed to the logs.
 */

/* Q: What is all this _SuperLib_... that I see all over?
 *
 * A: Unfortunately due to constraints in OpenTTD and Squirrel, only the main
 *    class of a library will be renamed at import. For SuperLib that is the
 *    SuperLib class in this file. Every other class in this file or other
 *    .nut files that the library is built up by will end up at the global
 *    scope at the AI that imports the library. The global scope of the 
 *    library will get merged with the global scope of your AI.
 *
 *    To reduce the risk of causing you conflict problems this library
 *    prefixes everything that ends up at the global scope of AIs with
 *    _SuperLib_. That is also why the library is not named Utils or something
 *    with higher risk of you already having at your global scope.
 *
 *    And to answer your ideas of splitting the library apart into many
 *    libraries, one for each class, that has the limitation that you
 *    can't have circular dependencies between your libraries which is needed.
 *
 *    You should however never need to use any of the _SuperLib_.. names as a
 *    user of this library. It is not even recommended to do so as it is
 *    part of the implementation and could change without notice.
